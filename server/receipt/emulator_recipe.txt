"Salo" is a traditional Ukrainian dish made from cured slabs of pork fat, usually taken from the back of the pig. It is a beloved and iconic food in Ukrainian cuisine, often served as a snack or appetizer. 
Here's a simple recipe for preparing salo:

Pork Fatback: 450 to 680 grams.

Coarse Salt: To taste.

Black Pepper: To taste.

Garlic (Optional): 2-3 cloves.



Prepare the Pork Fatback:

Choose fresh, high-quality pork fatback. It's essential to use uncured fat for this recipe.
Slice the fatback into thin slabs, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.
Score the Fat:

Optionally, you can make shallow cuts or score the fat to enhance the absorption of flavors.
Season with Salt and Pepper:

Generously sprinkle the fat slabs with coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper. Adjust the seasoning to your taste.
Add Garlic (Optional):

If you like, rub minced garlic over the fat slabs for added flavor. This step is optional but popular in some variations.
Let it Cure:

Place the seasoned fat slabs in a cool, dry place or in the refrigerator. Allow the fat to cure for at least 24 hours, allowing the flavors to meld.
Serve:

Once the salo has cured, it's ready to be served.
Serve thin slices of salo on rye bread or with mustard if desired.
